## Sounds of Twitter

Sounds of Twitter is a universal iOS application built for a term project in a joint Software Engineering / Sound Art (Fine Arts) class. 

Sounds of Twitter allows the user to use "soundification" to interpret live stream data from twitter, filtered using a hashtag or search of the user's choosing.
It provides several options for configuring the algorithm used to soundify the incoming tweets.

### Requirements

Sounds of twitter requires that you configure a set of Twitter API tokens in AppDelegate.swift; for more information about how to get a set of auth tokens see the twitter documentation [here](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens)
